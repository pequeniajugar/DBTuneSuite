## Benchmarks that Compare Systems

Comparative benchmarks across various database systems highlight performance trade-offs dependent on workload complexity and infrastructure configurations. Andjelić et al. (2008) initially demonstrated significant performance advantages for MySQL, particularly using the MyISAM storage engine, over PostgreSQL in basic SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and ORDER BY on datasets of about 40,000 rows. Their findings recommended MySQL for applications prioritizing raw query speed, whereas PostgreSQL provided better consistency and robustness.

In contrast, Salunke & Ouda (2024) presented a different scenario, using a custom benchmarking framework designed specifically for continuous-authentication applications. Their experiments on one-million-row tables indicated PostgreSQL significantly outperformed MySQL in SELECT queries, exhibiting latencies roughly 13 times lower in basic scenarios and about nine times faster with WHERE clauses. Additionally, PostgreSQL maintained low latency under mixed SELECT and INSERT workloads, while MySQL experienced notable latency increases. Thus, PostgreSQL exhibited superior concurrency performance and stability.

Comparisons between MySQL and MariaDB also reveal nuanced performance differences. Tongkaw & Tongkaw (2016) performed OLTP benchmarks on Xen virtual machines, comparing MariaDB 10.0.21 with MySQL 5.6. Their experiments revealed that MySQL consistently achieved approximately twice the throughput of MariaDB under high concurrency (up to 1,000 threads), despite similar resource utilization. Conversely, Min (2018) found MySQL and MariaDB could match the performance of commercial databases, such as MS SQL Server, particularly when indexing was employed and data sizes remained moderate. This suggests both MySQL and MariaDB are viable open-source alternatives to commercial databases in typical read-heavy scenarios.

Further comparative benchmarks between PostgreSQL and MariaDB by Han & Choi (2024) investigated performance under different storage bandwidth conditions. Their analysis highlighted that MariaDB was more efficient at utilizing limited storage bandwidth, while PostgreSQL excelled considerably at higher I/O capacities, achieving roughly three times MariaDB's throughput in scenarios with high-bandwidth NVMe storage.

DuckDB, a relatively new entrant introduced by Raasveldt & Mühleisen (2019), was compared against SQLite, MonetDBLite, and HyPer using analytical TPC-H queries. While initial tests showed comparable performance on smaller datasets, DuckDB significantly outperformed others on larger datasets, benefiting from its vectorized columnar execution model that enabled handling substantial analytical workloads efficiently on modest hardware.

Krocz et al. (2020) conducted comprehensive comparisons involving MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and an in-memory database (H2). Their study indicated that PostgreSQL consistently outperformed MySQL and MariaDB, particularly in complex queries involving JOIN and UPDATE operations. MariaDB, however, remained competitive with PostgreSQL on simpler operations such as SELECT and DELETE. MySQL showed performance degradation as data volumes increased, while PostgreSQL maintained efficient resource utilization.

In summary, these benchmark studies illustrate distinct strengths among database systems. PostgreSQL typically excels in complex queries and concurrency-heavy scenarios, consistently outperforming MySQL and MariaDB under high-I/O conditions. MySQL remains strong in scenarios demanding high OLTP throughput, particularly outperforming MariaDB. Meanwhile, MariaDB proves competitive under constrained storage bandwidth conditions. DuckDB notably excels in handling large-scale analytical workloads. Ultimately, database selection must carefully align with the specific performance demands and hardware infrastructure available.

The current research expands upon these prior studies by systematically benchmarking MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and DuckDB using the InnoDB storage engine across identical workloads and configurations. This comprehensive approach, particularly the inclusion of DuckDB alongside traditional relational databases and consistent use of InnoDB, aims to uncover new performance insights not previously documented. By maintaining uniform testing conditions and examining contemporary versions of these database systems, this study will provide fresh comparative data valuable for selecting optimal database solutions tailored to specific modern workloads.
